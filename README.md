# note-taker

## Description

This is supposed to be a simple note taking application that allows you to take notes and track them throughout your project or day or whatever you use case might be. It will allow you to take new notes, store them and recall them whenever. It will allow you to look at previous notes taken as well as delete whichever notes are either completed or no longer relevant.

## Use

A use case for this would be if you're anything like myself, forgetful. This application will allow you to take notes and remind yourself later. They can be quick notes from a class session or more of a to-do list for yourself later.
